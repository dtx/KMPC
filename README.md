#Kinect Media Player Controller:
==============
(I have just put the SVN repository into git, therefore the branches/tags/trunk
directories)


Many people connect their PC to their big flat screen TV to watch movies.
Usually HDMI cords are not long enough for people to put their PCs on the sofa.
So people need to get up from the sofa each time when they want to control
the movie (play, stop, pause etc). It will be wonderful if there is a software
that can use a kinect camera to detect hand gestures and control the PC.
